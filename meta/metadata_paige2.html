			<p> I went to Hawaii when I was in 7th grade. I went for 2 and a half weeks.
			I stayed at a house with my family and we had a blast. The weather when we went
			was so beautiful. It only rained once or twice and only for about 5 minutes.<p>
			<p> The beaches in Hawaii were so nice. One day we went snorkeling and saw many
			fish and turtles. Another day we were zip linning which was also very fun.<p>
			<p>We spent most of the days in Hawaii relaxing on the beach. When you would go
			in the water, just to swim, you would see many fish, turtles, and even some
			seals! Most of the beaches had snow cone places that you would able to walk
			to which was nice when you wanted something refreshing<p>
			<p> Overall Hawaii was a very fun and enjoyable trip! I recommend everyone to 
			go to Hawaii on vacation at some point in their life!<p>
