		<h2>Basic Information</h2>
		<p>The Amur leopard lives in Russia, China, and possibly North Korea.
		They get their names for the Amur river, which flows into the sea at the 
		eastern end of Russia. Amur leopards are slightly smaller than other types
		of leopards but have longer legs than the other leopards. Males weigh
		around 32-48 kg, and females weigh around 25-43 kg. Males are about 
		107-136 cm long and their tails are 82-90 cm long.</p>
<!-- why this animal is endangered-->
		<h2>Why They Are Endangered</h2>
		<p>Right now in the wild there are only around 70 Amur leopards left. There
		are more of them living in zoos then there are living in the wild. They are 
		endangered because of how much they are being poached. They are being poached
		because of their beautiful, spotted fur. Their fur can be sold at $500 all the
		way up to $1000. Agriculture and villages surround the forests where the leopards
		live, causing the forests to be relatively accessible, making poaching a 
		problem.</p><br />

		<h2>How They Are Trying To Stop Them From Being Endangered</h2>
		<p>WWF supports antipoaching work in all Amur leopard habitats in the Far East of 
		Russia and in northeast China. WWF implements programs to stop the illegal trade
		in Amur leopard parts. They also help governments enforce domestic and 
		international trade restrictions on Amur leopard products. WWF monitors the 
		population and habitat of the Amur leopard. To protect the habitat and population 
		of the Amur leopard they have to increase areas of protected land in both Russia 
		and China, reducing illegal and unsustainable logging practices, and facilitating 
		trade between companies committed to responsible forestry practices. WWF has also 
		worked to successfully lobby the Russian government reroute a planned oil pipeline
		that would have endangered the Amur leopard.</p>
