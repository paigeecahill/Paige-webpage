<!-- this is some information about Petra-->

		<p> Petra is a historical and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Petra is 
		more popular for its 800 individual monuments that includes buildings, tombs, 
		baths, funerary halls, temples, arched gateways, and colonnaded streets, that 
		were mostly carved from the sandstone. The city was established in 312 B.C.  
		making it one of the oldest metropolises in the world. Petra lies on a slope in 
		the basin among the mountains which form the eastern flank of Arabah valley that 
		runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. </p>

<blockquote><i> Little Petra is beautiful! Climb up the steps right to the back and 
onto the rocks for a stunning view. It's very close to Petra and you can get there and 
back in an hour or stay watching the view for a long time. I'm glad I made the effort.

<blockquote><i>What an amazing site! Petra was really out of this world. It was 
unbelievable. No words can describe the amazing accomplishments of the Nabateans. 
You need a lot of time though to properly explore Petra. Allow at least three days, 
and even then you will have not seen everything.</i></blockquote>
